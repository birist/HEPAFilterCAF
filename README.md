# HEPAFilterCAF

This simple Python script converts a .caf file into an xml file, imports an xml library and searches for specific values, intending to find the range high value on pressure sensors, and then populates them into a .csv spreadsheet for comparison to a list of pressure sensors on biosafety lab hepa filters. There were a couple hundred of them, this made it a lot quicker.
